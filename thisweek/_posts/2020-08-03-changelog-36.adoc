== New Features

* We started the effort to share the parser between rust-analyzer and rustc.
  This will take a while to complete, and won't give any new user-visible features until completion.
  As the first step, rust-analyzer now uses
  https://github.com/rust-analyzer/ungrammar/blob/da1aa8a99738c1a4fe5e321e39aae857c1eb54c8/rust.ungram[this grammar]
  to generate syntax tree structure.
* pr:5547[] fold multiline parameter lists.

* pr:5561[]: allow running more tests at once via the module runners:

* pr:5563[] Check all targets for package-level tasks.
  When invoking "Select Runnable" with the caret on a runnable with a specific target (test, bench, binary), append the corresponding argument for the `cargo check -p` module runnable.

* pr:5586[] Support new sysroot layout on nightly.

== Fixes

* pr:5596[] add checkOnSave.noDefaultFeatures and correct how we handle some cargo flags.
* pr:5565[] don't mix non-path-based rules with path-based in **S**tructural **S**earch **R**eplace.
* pr:5554[] fix **Remove dbg** assist to not remove meaningful parenthesis and semicolons.
* pr:5567[] wrap placeholder expansions in SSR in parenthesis when necessary.
* pr:5513[] when generating launch.json configurations, correctly handle multi-folder workspaces.

== Internal Improvements

* pr:5572[] Switch to ungrammar for generating syntax trees.
* pr:5574[] Replace rand with oorandom.
* pr:5581[] Use perf-events to measure number of instructions in addition to wall clock time for https://rust-analyzer.github.io/metrics/[metrics] to get more stable measurements on CI. That plan was foiled by perf not working on the CI.
* pr:5573[], pr:5578[], ... : rename various AST types
